v0.6:

        * Reworked config page to add many more options.  Config options
        are now respected by pykaraoke_mini as well as by pykaraoke
        (though the config dialog itself is only accessible via
        pykaraoke).

        * Added capability to convert cdg files to mpg, via the --dump
        command-line option.

        * Added support for an external movie player, for instance,
        Windows Media Player or mplayer, to play video file formats not
        supported directly by pygame, such as AVI.  Using this method,
        full-motion video karaoke files can now be played on the GP2X.

        * The search/playlist window now has a user-draggable splitter
        handle to control the relative size of the search and playlist
        sides.  It's also possible to configure whether they should be
        split vertically (left/right) or horizontally (top/bottom).

        * Added pulldown menus to the search/playlist window.  Moved some
        of the buttons on that window into the menu.

        * Added options to print or export the song list.

        * Added the ability to edit a song's artist or title on-the-fly
        from within the search window.  The changes are written back into
        the appropriate titles*.txt file.

        * Fixed international character support for kar files.

        * Fixed some incorrect lyrics detection in kar file parsing.

        * Fixed a bug preventing loading titles*.txt files from nested
        subdirectories within zip files.

        * Changed the text colour on the pykaraoke_mini browser to
        indicate the type of Karaoke file: kar, cdg, or mpg.

        * Added left/right arrow keys to the pykaraoke_mini browser.
        These skip to the next letter.

        * The pykaraoke_mini browser will collapse multiple song files
        sharing the same artist / title into a single line.

        * Changed sound-sync keys from left/right arrow to
        control-left/right arrow, to reduce accidental use of these keys.

        * Further minor performance improvements to CDG player.

        * Added automatic control of GP2X CPU speed.  This improves both
        response time and battery life on the GP2X.

        * Changed meaning of the shoulder buttons on GP2X.  Now right
        button + joystick up/down means to skip a full page at a time;
        left button + joystick left/right means to zoom the text smaller
        or larger.

        * New progress bar visible while scanning database.

v0.5.1:

        * All: Update all copyright dates.

        * pykversion.py: Increase to v0.5.1.

        * pykaraoke.py: Fix slow CDG playback with WxPython v2.8 by
        overriding the default MainLoop() and making it sleep plenty.

        * pykaraoke.py: Allow WxPython v2.8, fix usage of system variable
        name now used by Wx 2.8.

        * _pycdgAux.c, pycdgAux.py: Fix potential array bounds problem
        with corrupt CDG data.

        * pykaraoke.py: More sensible sizing of column in search results
        and made Title and Artist columns more visible.

        * pykaraoke.py: Check for WxPython v2.6.

        * Reduced size of visible display of CDG graphics from 294x204 to
        288x192, based on a new understanding of a presumed typo in the
        CDG document.  This appears to solve some minor scrolling issues.

v0.5:

        * Fixed a problem in pykar.py with synchronization of lyrics to
        music on certain MIDI files (files in which the tempo changes
        during the song).

        * Reworked rendering engine in pykar.py to support wordwrap and
        font scaling.

        * Wrote pykaraoke_mini.py, with an in-window scrolling interface
        for environments in which a full keyboard/mouse is not available.

        * Added pykplayer.py and pykmanager.py to collect together common
        bits of code between the various player types.

        * Made command-line options available to all public entry points:
        pycdg.py, pykar.py, pymgr.py, pykaraoke.py, and pykaraoke_mini.py.

        * Replaced threading code with explicit calls to manager.Poll().

        * Moved the CDG-processing code from pycdg.py into pycdgAux.py,
        and also ported it down to C in _pycdgAux.c for further runtime
        optimization.

        * Pushed default framerate back to 30 fps.  Setting it lower than
        that has limited benefit with the new codebase.

        * Added --zoom to control the mode in which pycdg.py scales its
        display to fit the window.

        * Added command-line parameters to control audio properties.

        * Added separate "titles" and "artists" columns to the song
        database, making it possible to sort the returned songlist by any
        of the three columns.  The file titles.txt can be defined in the
        directory with all of your song files to define the title and/or
        artist for each song.

        * Ported to the GP2X.

        * Fixed horizontal scrolling CDGs.

        * Smoother CDG scrolling.

        * pycdg.py: Fix "scratchy" audio on some systems.

        * pykar.py: Support non-ASCII, non-unicode charsets <mantask>.

        * pykaraoke.py: Add charset option & launch from command-line
        <mantask>.

        * pykaraoke.desktop: Add task-launcher file for file associations
        <mantask>.

        * pykaraoke.py: Show pykaraoke.xpm icon as WX window icon.

v0.4.2:
        * pycdg.py: Allow CDG filenames without extension (just a .) to allow for
        tab-completion.

        * pycdg.py: Fix border preset (don't clear full-screen).

        * pycdg.py: Add --nomusic option.

        * pycdg.py: pycdg: Fix option type 'str' in optparse

        * pycdg.py: pycdg: Fix FutureWarning on 0xFFFFFFFFs

        * pykaraoke.py: Add drag-and-drop support from search results and within
        playlist.

        * pykaraoke.py: Add drag-and-drop from Folder View

        * pykaraoke.py: Reuse PyKaraoke without the GUI from Craig Rindy:
        scripters might find it useful to reuse many things
        implemented in pykaraoke.py such as zip file handling.
        The attached patch allows the pykaraoke module (in
        particular PyKaraokeManager) to be used without the
        main application window. The patch also includes a
        refactoring of SongDB.FolderScan to allow for reuse.

        * pykaraoke.py: Support non-ASCII characters in filenames from Craig Rindy:
        Any valid file can be imported, and filenames that present
        problems in the search are skipped so that the search may
        continue through the rest of the database.

v0.4.1:

        * pycdg.py: Fix typo in "CDG file may be corrupt" warning (wwf)

        * pycdg.py: Add -t/--title option to set the window title to
        something specific (useful for window managers that can remember
        window settings like sticky, size, location, stacking, desktop,
        etc., based on window title/name/class attributes, like
        Enlightenment does) (wwf)

        * Add install script and /usr/bin links in install directory.

        * Get icons and fonts from current directory or /usr/share/pykaraoke.

        * Use /usr/bin/env for shebang.

        * pykaraoke.py: Add KAR inside ZIP fix from Andrei Gavrila.

        * pykaraoke.py: Add mid/mpg extension fix from Andrei Gavrila.

        * pycdg.py: Default to 10 frames per second.

        * pycdg.py: Fix scrolling variable names

        * pykaraoke.py: Fix wx 2.6 API change.

        * pycdg.py: Split the screen into 24 tiles for better screen
        update performance.

        * pycdg.py: Lower delay time when no packets are due.

        * pycdg.py: Don't update the screen if 1/4 second out of sync.

        * pycdg.py: Don't specify the display depth, pygame will use the
        most appropriate.

v0.4:

        * Use optparse to support additional command-line options
        (optparse is included in Python 2.3 and newer, on all standard
        Python-supporting platforms); run "pycdg.py --help" to see a full
        list of supported options.

        * Permit user to specify window's starting X and Y positions

        * Permit user to specify window's starting X and Y sizes

        * Permit user to start the player in fullscreen mode

        * Permit user to specify FPS on command line, defaults to 60

        * Pass cdgPlayer.__init__() an "options" object now instead of a
        filename; contains size_x, size_y, pos_x, pos_y, fullscreen,
        cdgFileName

        * cdgPlayer.run(): it's pedantic, but use self.Close() instead of
        setting self.State manually

        * Add key binding "q" to exit ([ESC] still works)

        * Hide the mouse cursor (both in fullscreen and in windowed mode)

        * Fix "Frames Per Second" so it's honored (previously it was
        ignored because curr_pos wasn't always updated as often as needed)

        * Change order of import statements so local versions of pygame,
        Numeric can be picked up if present.

        * Check for all mixed-case cases of matching audio files (mp3,
        ogg)

        * Misc. tab/spacing fixes in "constant" definitions

v0.3.1:

        * Added full-screen player mode (CDG and MPG)

        * Supports the latest WxPython (v2.6)

        * Improved CPU usage

        * Displays ZIP filename together with the internal song filename

v0.3:

        * Added MIDI/KAR file support

        * CDG player now uses psyco for faster playback on low-end
        machines

        * Better handling of corrupt CDG rips

        * Minor changes to make it more OSX-friendly

        * Added facility for cancelling song database builds in PyKaraoke
        GUI

v0.2.1:

        * Fixed colour cycling in the CDG player

        * Fixed transparent colours used in CDG files

        * Searches are optimised to handle thousands of CDG files very
        quickly

        * Fixed inaccurate right-clicking in the playlist on some systems

        * Fixed Windows drive icon

        * Fixed tree root issue on some Linux systems

        * Added more status messages to the status bars
