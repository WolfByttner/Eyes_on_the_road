Eyes on the road is a hardware and software sensor suite designed to prevent drivers from falling asleep at the wheel.
Using advanced sensor fusion and face tracking trained with a neural network we not only can tell when a driver is 
becoming fatigued but also predict tiring situations. We use a Bosch XDK and Logitec webcam to monitor car swerving,
temperature, driver nodding off and more.
